# Data Scraping
## Creating datasets for Machine Learning and Data Analysis scraping data online 

In order to realise these projects I made use of the following guides and tutorials: <br>

[Tutorial: Web Scraping and BeautifulSoup](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/web-scraping-beautifulsoup/) <br>
[Tutorial: Python Web Scraping Using BeautifulSoup](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/web-scraping-tutorial-python/) <br>

In order to scrape web pages that use javascript, it is neessary to consider alternative approaches to BeautifulSoup. One solution can be to use selenium web driver to connect to a web page either with Firefox web driver, PhantomJS, headless browser. <br>
